This document is explaining trellis encoding in easy to explain words

Trellis encoding acomplishes 2 things at once, modulation, and encoding. 
Modulation is useful because it allows you to be able to correct errors.
Encoding is useful because it makes your transmission longer, which is better for all transmission reciveing. 

The problem is that more encoding makes your transmission more error prone, which will require more complex modulation to fix.
Trellis encoding accomplishes these two things at the same time, all while not affecting the bandwith or power of the transmission. 
The Trellis encoder uses the idea of convultion coding to modulate.
Convolution coding is the idea that given a current state, there are only certain states you can get too.
assume we have 2 bits(00, 01, 10, 11), and each are essintially a queue. when we add a bit, the right most bit is poped off and the left one shifted to the right, and the new bit made the left bit.
ie we have 10, we get a 1, the next state is 11.  ie. we have 01, we get a 1, the next state is 10. ie we have 00, we get a 0, next state is 00.
If we force our bits too follow this pattern, we can tell if an error has occured by seeing if an invalid state transition occured

The encoding occurs by adding an extra bit, usually from xor-ing the input bits with bits from N previous symbols. 
This increases the bit length, usually by 1

By applying the convolution code idea with the additonal bit added, we can error correct and encode at the same time. 

In 8VSB, the trellis encoder does a 2/3 modulation.
